### DevOps Interview Notes

---

#### **1. Shell Commands**
Shell commands are fundamental in DevOps for automating tasks, managing systems, and handling various operations.

- **Basic Commands:**
  - `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
  - `cd`: Changes the current directory.
  - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
  - `cp`: Copies files or directories.
  - `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories.
  - `rm`: Removes files or directories.
  - `echo`: Displays a line of text.
  - `touch`: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
  - `cat`: Concatenates and displays file content.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  ls -la
  cd /var/www
  cp file.txt /backup/
  rm -rf /old_files/
  ```

#### **2. SSH for Remote Access**
Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for securely connecting to remote servers, allowing you to execute commands and manage systems.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **SSH Key Authentication:** Uses public and private key pairs for authentication.
  - **SSH Agent:** Manages SSH keys and provides a secure way to use them without needing to enter the passphrase multiple times.

- **Common SSH Commands:**
  - `ssh user@hostname`: Connects to a remote server.
  - `scp file user@hostname:/path`: Securely copies files to a remote server.
  - `ssh-keygen`: Generates an SSH key pair.
  - `ssh-agent`: Starts an SSH agent session.
  - `ssh-add`: Adds a private key to the SSH agent.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa musaveer@192.168.1.10
  scp localfile.txt musaveer@remote:/path/to/destination
  ```

#### **3. Virtualization**
Virtualization allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine, optimizing resource usage.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Hypervisor:** Software that creates and manages VMs (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, KVM).
  - **Virtual Machine:** An emulation of a computer system that runs its own operating system.
  - **Containers:** Lightweight alternatives to VMs, sharing the host OS kernel (e.g., Docker).

- **Examples:**
  - **Creating a VM in VirtualBox:**
    - Define the OS type, allocate CPU and memory, and create a virtual disk.
  - **Docker Container Example:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
    ```

#### **4. Text Editors for File Editing**
Text editors like `vim` and `nano` are essential for editing configuration files and scripts directly on servers.

- **Vim:**
  - **Modes:** Command mode, Insert mode, and Visual mode.
  - **Basic Commands:**
    - `i`: Enter insert mode.
    - `:wq`: Save and exit.
    - `dd`: Delete a line.
    - `/pattern`: Search for a pattern.

- **Nano:**
  - **Basic Commands:**
    - `Ctrl + O`: Save file.
    - `Ctrl + X`: Exit.
    - `Ctrl + K`: Cut a line.
    - `Ctrl + W`: Search for text.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  vim /etc/hosts
  nano ~/.bashrc
  ```

---

#### **5. File System Permissions**
Understanding file permissions is crucial for managing access to files and directories on Unix-based systems.

- **Permission Types:**
  - **Read (r):** Permission to read a file or list a directory.
  - **Write (w):** Permission to modify a file or directory.
  - **Execute (x):** Permission to execute a file or traverse a directory.

- **Changing Permissions:**
  - `chmod`: Changes file permissions.
  - `chown`: Changes file owner and group.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  chmod 755 script.sh  # rwxr-xr-x
  chown user:group file.txt
  ```

---

#### **6. Package Management (apt, yum)**
Package managers like `apt` (Debian-based) and `yum` (RHEL-based) are used to install, update, and manage software packages.

- **APT Commands:**
  - `sudo apt update`: Updates the package list.
  - `sudo apt install package_name`: Installs a package.
  - `sudo apt upgrade`: Upgrades all installed packages.

- **YUM Commands:**
  - `sudo yum check-update`: Checks for available updates.
  - `sudo yum install package_name`: Installs a package.
  - `sudo yum update`: Updates all packages.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nginx
  sudo yum install httpd
  ```

---

#### **7. Process and Service Management**
Managing processes and services is vital for maintaining system stability and performance.

- **Process Management:**
  - `ps`: Displays information about active processes.
  - `top`: Provides a dynamic view of running processes.
  - `kill`: Sends a signal to a process (e.g., to terminate it).

- **Service Management:**
  - `systemctl start service_name`: Starts a service.
  - `systemctl stop service_name`: Stops a service.
  - `systemctl status service_name`: Checks the status of a service.

- **Examples:**
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep nginx
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  kill -9 1234  # Terminate process with PID 1234
  ```
